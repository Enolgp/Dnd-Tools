# Dnd-Tools
Tools that can be usefull in dnd games for both GM and players (specially GM)
This projet started when my GM suggested me to make a tool for ease some parts of the dnd game such as calculate the price of a magic item. And I make this project to group different tools that I will make and sharing them with the community in the process

# Tools
### Price calculator
A tool for calculate the price of a magic object introducing the rarity of the object, the number and the lvl of the spells contained in the object, the permanency of the magic, if the object requires attunement and the charisma bonus of the character trying to buy the object.
The output is the base price, the discount or tax of the attunement and charisma bonus and the final price (considerating the tax or discount)
The formula was obtained from a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreens/comments/uiwo1n/magic_items_pricing_guide_for_5e_a_spreadsheet)

To use the app you can download the project or only the folder and execute the file "init.html" in the web browser or you can use it from this url: https://enolgp.github.io/Dnd-Tools/price-calculator/
